## Project Description

[Netlify url](https://flamboyant-ramanujan-b00f82.netlify.app/)

This project will be a full CRUD application for Video Game Ratings. It will be similar to Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic. Most likely I will focus just on console exclusive games.

## User Stories

- User can view all video games on the site
- User can click a category (PS4, Nintendo Switch, XBOX One) to view games for that system
- User can click on genre type to view games in that genre
- User can click a game to view critic reviews
- User can create a user review for selected game
- User can delete and update their own reviews
- User can add a game to the list and edit the content

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP (examples)

- mobile responsive first design
- hamburger menu/nav bar
- button/event listeners
- all page, console page, review page
- add/edit modal
- bootstrap for overall layout and design
- jQuery and API intergration

#### PostMVP

- genre section
- animations
- logo

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions. Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

#### MVP

| Component        | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| ---------------- | :------: | :------------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Hamburger        |    H     |      2hr       |      -hr       |     -hr     |

#### PostMVP

| Component     | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| ------------- | :------: | :------------: | :------------: | :---------: |
