# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Unit 2 Project - Build a full CRUD website

## Overview

This project will give you a chance to use the skills we've learned in class to create a full CRUD site using the skills that you have learned in this unite. You'll get a chance to use JavaScript to tackle interactions such as an image slider, a responsive hamburger menu, as well as a custom API using MongoDB, Mongoose and Express backend.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you throughout the process and helping as you go.

## Requirements
It is important to keep in mind the goal of this program and these projects, they are to utilize the skills you have been taught and the skills that employers care about. You should strive to build projects that will catch an employers eye and get you hired.

### Technical Requirements
Two separate repo's are requied for this project, one for the Back-End and one for the Front-End. They must not reside on the same repo.

**Back-End Requirements:**

- Your back-end must be a Node, Express, and Mongoose API with at least 2
  models, more if needed, and one association.
- Must have Create, Read, Update, and Destroy functionality built throughout the
  app (i.e. You don't need full CRUD on every model, just full CRUD throughout
  your models where it makes sense).

**Front-End Requirements:**
- Your front-end must use JQuery and leverage the backend API.
- You must communicate with the back-end API RESTfully to Create, Read, Update,
  and Destroy resources.
- Your frontend must be responsive and work on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops
- A mobile nav that expands and collapses when a user clicks on the hamburger icon.

Review the [Rubric](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEIR-629/project-2/blob/master/evaluation-rubric.md) for the specifics of how your project will
be graded.


### Necessary Deliverables
Your submission must include **all** of the following:

#### Project Idea and Initial Planning
By the end of Day 1 you need to submit:

1. Your project idea (a brief 2-3 sentence description of your app)
2. A list of your models and their properties
3. Link to the `frontend` repository with project worksheet
4. Link to the `backend` repository with project worksheet

These and any other planning assets (wireframes, user stories, etc) should go
inside a `planning/` directory inside your `backend` and `frontend` project repository accordingly.

### Suggested Ways to Start

- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short-term problems.
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies, frameworks, or APIs you use**.
- **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
- **Commit early, commit often**. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Keep user stories small and well-defined**. Remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- **Make it all well-formatted**. Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc.?
- **Comment your code**. Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code**. Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Final Application

Your project is due on the last day of Project Week. Create an issue on this repo containing:

- A link to your deployed application
- A link to your Project 2 Github repositories

The repository for your backend API should include:

- A working JSON API built using Express and Mongoose that meets the technical requirements above.
- Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- A `planning/` directory in the root of your `backend` and `frontend` repo that contains a `readme` with all: 
    - A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**.
    - Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    - Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of  views and interfaces in your application.
    - Link to your **Time/Priority** matrix 
    - Table including functionality and estimated/actual time for completion
    - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **hurdles** you had to overcome.

The repository for the frontend of your application should include:

- A working frontend application built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery ect.
- CRUD functionality
- Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- Mobile first, responsive web application (Mobile, Tablet and Desktop).

#### Deployment

- Your API Backend must be deployed to Heroku and your front-end must be deployed to
  Netlify. Applications that are not deployed will be considered incomplete.
