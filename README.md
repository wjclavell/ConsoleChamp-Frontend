## App Description

This app is a rating/review site, similar to Rotten Tomatoes. It focuses on console exclusive games (games that ONLY release for one console: PS4, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch). The goal is to have a database of user and critic reviews for each game, and have an overall rating system to see which console has the "best" exclusives. All games in the database are displayed on the home page. A description and list of reviews are available when a game is selected.
